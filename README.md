# Old School GitHub (Chrome extension)

GitHub rolled out a brand new UI on June 23, 2020. There are a few aspects of the new UI that I (and many others) don't like and this extension brings back a few features from the old UI:

1. **Move headers to main content area:** In the June update, GitHub moved the header buttons ("Code"/"Issues"/"Pull Requests"/etc) to the far left of the page. This was only an issue if you have a big wide monitor because those buttons are now very very far from the rest of the page content. If you're on a laptop you probably won't notice the difference.

2. **Highlight selected page in header:** Prior to the update, the selected page you're on was clearly highlighted. The update made the current page selection much more subtle.

3. **Classic-syle buttons:** The old buttons had depth, and the new buttons are flat and look less clickable. 

4. **Add row separators in file explorer:** The file explorer that shows all the files and folders currently has no borders between rows, making it harder to read the file list.

5. **Remove circular user images:** This one isn't necessarily a bad change, but just to keep with the classic GitHub UI, I reverted the new circular user images to the old square (but with rounded corners) images.
